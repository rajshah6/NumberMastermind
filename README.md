# NumberMastermind

Note: Only works on MacOS due to Tkinter window formatting.

This is a GUI based program using tkinter that is programmed to be a random guessing game where the user tries to guess the number. Start the game and choose a number between 1-9, this range can be changed later. Use the number buttons to enter your guess, the game will tell you if your number is greater, lower or equal to the secret number. If you guess the secret number correctly in less attempts than the maximum guesses, you win! Otherwise, you can try again and adjust the maximum number, lowest number, and maximum guesses!
